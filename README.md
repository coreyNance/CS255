# •	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The Client is DriverPass is a startup driver training company created to fill a need for better driver training because many people tend to fail their driving test at the DMV and the owner of this startup is Liam. The project is to design a learning management system, as a high-level overview, is to build a system that will handle everything to do with users taking online classes and practice tests as well as on-the-road training. This system is to help users access data from anywhere whether its online or offline. The system has to be able to allow some information to be updated offline as well as to be able to have access to the data online from any computer or mobile device, with minimizing possible redundancies.  



# •	What did you do particularly well?

Overall, the business requirements section where the system description, nonfunctional and functional requirements	 and the interface requirements were done particularly well.  For the most part finding valuable sources helped to understand what requirements the DriverPass system would need.

# •	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

When it comes to the UML diagrams, this is an area where improvement can happen.  For the most part the sequence, class, and activity diagrams are straightforward when it comes to a basic understanding of what they are doing. Where the improvement comes in is completely knowing how to illustrate the differenct relationships for example, knowing when to use a solid line on a sequence diagram or a dashed line.  With a Use Case diagram, knowing how to connect the use cases without cluttering up the diagram also helps.  To try and improve this, one would think more practice with it and further research will help to gain more knowledge so the plan would be not to shy away from this task but to find more reasons to practice these diagrams.

# •	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

To interpret a user’s needs is to first set up a meeting to go over what is a need and what is a want.   Every system designed impacts the company’s operations to enhance processes and help make changes to grow the business for the future. For this reason, developers designing the system should know the environment they are dealing with (Grebennikov, 2022).  It’s very important to clarify a need-based requirement and a want. Doing this will allow for the development team to map out a plan for the system. This plan would first be organized on a business requirements document where the requirements would be summarized as objectives or goals, which would then be broken down into functional, nonfunctional or interface type of requirements.  It’s extremely important to have clear requirements to reduce development costs and finish the project faster (Tkachenko, 2019). 

# •	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

 The main approach of preference to designing software would be the Object-Oriented Design. This design works with the entities and their characteristics instead of the function of the system (Tutorialspoint n.d). The techniques to use would first be to use the clients system needs information to create a business requirements document while using any UML diagram that would pertain to the needs of the client. This strategy would be used in any future analysis and design of a system.
